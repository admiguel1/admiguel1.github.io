Map of My Favorite Destinations

The locations I have choosen are places I have visited and are planning on visiting in the future. Athens, Greece is a place I have not visited. The city has always caught my eye ever since I was young. Sequioa Nationl Park is close to my hometown, going there as a small trip out of town is common.
